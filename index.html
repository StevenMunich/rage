		<h3>"He said the dead soldiers go to Hell, That fucking guy. You know who he is"</h3>
		<br>
		<p>In summer of 2012, when this all started People were talking<br/> about dead soldiers as if I had done something wrong..<br/>
		the man in a black suit with a gold watch saying: <br/> "I'd like to see him DIE FOR HIS COUNTRY" (God speaks for us all) <br/>
		or<br/>
		that young kid who thought he was a prophet putting me in my place<br/> by talking really loud about the corpses of soldiers, which at<br/> the time I was not talking about them, at all, or personally. But<br/> rather the war itself, which is being used by Satan to control<br/> this country. When I told this kid what i saw and heared in DC<br/> my voice sounded like thunder and waterfalls. <br/> His jaw dropped and he ran off.
		</p>
		<br>
		<p>If these people had respect for soldiers they wouldn't be using their corpses <br/>as a strawman argument. How do I win against such a debate? I will always look like the bad gay. </p>
		<p>and How do I win? By letting you people find out when its too late?<br/>
I never made any sacrafices: My Life, Career, Love</p>
		<br>
		<p>NOW THIS IS THE MOST SERIOUS ISSUE, Look into my motivations.
		<br/>"Girl he loves is fucking all these people HAHA look at him, thats why he does it and he deserves it"
		<br/>IS IT FUNNY?<br/>
		I can replace a girlfreind, but you can't bring your soldiers back</p>
		
		
		<p>And Mr. President, do not chase my tail.<br/> 
You will only look like a fool. WHO AM I TO YOU?</p>
<h2>Nothing makes God laugh more than a rich man doing the most petty shit.</h2>
	<p>Chase my tail Mr. President, A man who you consider a scapegoat. <br/>Tell a cop to follow those orders, he gives up all personable responsibility and accountablity.
"Oh i was just following orders" without consciencly thinking "Is this Right or is this Wrong?" You can not have Consciousness without a conscience
</p>
		
<p>"Its florida Law" "I was just doing my job". So you're gonna say to God "I did not know who he was". All over the internet and TV. Meme's, south park character, The media didn't even know how to explain the Vegas shooting.</p>


		<p>I do the same when I trust in God, I follow his instructions. Even when it makes no sense...at the time. But this is God giving me orders, "Everything I do".<br/>
		I had to do something I really didn't want to do. I knew people would hate me for it. The alternative is having more soldiers GO TO HELL because a doctrine of demon encouraged their "Martyrdom". I remember reading that doctrine at "Paradise" beach. As it said:
		</p>
		<p style="background-color: yellow; font-weight: bold;">"This war is not about going from earth over seas but rather going from earth to heaven"</p>

	<h2>Woe unto you that desire the day of the Lord! to what end is it for you? the day of the Lord is darkness, and not light. <br/>Amos 5:18</h2>
	
	<p>If i didn't do what I did your ground troops would be more than eager to die(on their own terms) and face God. Only to find out he did so because a demon told him to.
</p>
	<p>"I was just doing my job". So you're gonna say to God "I did not know who he was". If no laws were broken why is there a police officer at my property? Demanding I open the door and come outside, as if you had no plans to harm me at all. The internet and TV. Meme's and south park episodes, even a character.</p>
	<p>So many Americans are jealous:</p>
	<p style="color:red">	'In America "all men created equal" who does this <br/>guy think he is?!?!<br/>....<br/>Like God would choose him instead of me, HAH. Why did God choose him?!?! WHY DIDNT HE CHOOSE ME!?!?
	<br/> Maybe if i piss him off enough he will tell everyone what a shithead I am and I will be FAMOUS!!! like him except I deserve it
	</p>
	<p>I have only seen 1 other person speak with The Holy Spirit. An older Woman, as she spoke about the Holy Spirit the church was lite up with His Presence. Prophecy is not about "being famous" AT ALL.</p>
	
	<h3>And you, O son of man, take a sharp sword. Use it as a barber's razor and pass it over your head and your beard. Then take balances for weighing and divide the hair. 2 A third part you shall burn in the fire in the midst of the city, when the days of the siege are completed. And a third part you shall take and strike with the sword all around the city. And a third part you shall scatter to the wind, and I will unsheathe the sword after them. 3 And you shall take from these a small number and bind them in the skirts of your robe. 4 And of these again you shall take some and cast them into the midst of the fire and burn them in the fire. From there a fire will come out into all the house of Israel.<h3>
